## This is a simple chat platform where there are three types of users:

-    Normal Users:
-    Register and Login to the system using a unique usernames.
-    Can view list of other users.
-    Later Can chat in the assigned chatroom with other users. (for now)
-    Later, add ability to make Direct messaging possible

-    Moderator :

     -    Can kick or ban users.
     -    Can report Admins about any issues.
     -    Can warn a normal chat user by a click of a button
     -    Cannot kick other moderators, but can report them to admin

-    Admin
     -    can assign moderators or strip their role
     -    can kick anybody. If they kick a moderator, their role gets removed from their database.

## Database to use :

MongoDB, Mongoose ORM

# Authentication :

-    Google sign in button (very simple for now, can be bypassed easily, but that's besides the point)
-
