## This is a simple chat platform where there are three types of users:

-    Normal Users:
-    Can signup using a google-sign in button (no proper authentication for now, as using emails would be painful due to spam reports)
-    Can chat in the assigned chatroom with other users. (for now)
-    Later, add ability to make Direct messaging possible

-    Moderator :

     -    Can kick or ban users.
     -    Can report Admins about any issues.
     -    Can warn a normal chat user by a click of a button
     -    Cannot kick other moderators, but can report them to admin

-    Admin
     -    can assign moderators or strip their role
     -    can kick anybody. If they kick a moderator, their role gets removed from their database.
